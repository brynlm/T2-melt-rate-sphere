# T2-melt-rate-sphere

Research project for Science One: Modeling the melting rate of an ice cube by designing a predictive model in python. 
The python program calculates the rates of convective and radiative heat transfer based on the dimensions of the ice cube, 
which is then used to calculate the melting rate. Ice cube melting rates were measured with a kitchen scale over time. 
The collected data was compared with the python model. 

Included is the .csv file containing the actual observed data, which is called in the python code to put in a matplot graph.
